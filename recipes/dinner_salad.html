    <h2>Description</h2>
    Salads need no introduction as they are always a top of the line when the topic is "healthy eating". The best athletes in the world have also chosen salads to be their primary meal and for good. To a surprise to many people, salads might all look the same due to their green attire but in reality, they are extremely versatile solely due to the numerous salad dressings and countless vegetables to choose from!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    The recipe I will be sharing today needs no cooking, no dressing of any kind, and is made up of 4 ingredients only.
    <ul>
        <li>Cucumbers</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Carrots</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    The steps are mostly chopping and the time really depends on your portion size and how skilled you're at chopping (which I am not at all!).
    <ol>
        <li>Chop cucumbers, tomatoes, and carrots with or without skin</li>
        <li>Sprinkle some salt based on your preference</li>
        <li>Enjoy your Salad!</li>
    </ol>
