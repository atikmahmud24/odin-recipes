    <p>Welcome to my website. Here, we have brought together an ideal diet that is comprised of <strong>3 meals</strong> with a strong focus on <em>protein and calcium.</em></p>
    
    <p><h3><a href="recipes/morning_oats.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Morning Oats</a></h2></p>
    The morning oats can never go wrong. Not only is it rich in calcium, vitamin, and protein, but it is also extremely versatile as you can always pair it up with a fruit of your choice.
